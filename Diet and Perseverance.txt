Yesterday I looked in the mirror and I almost didn't recognize myself anymore, as soon as I saw my reflected image I exclaimed: <But who is this?>.
Until that moment I hadn't realized I realize how fat I was, until then I had deceived the truth with excuses such as: <But a jog is enough for me, eat less and I'll be thin as before>, 
 but the reality is often disappointing. 
With all the courage I had in my body, I took the scale, covered with months of dust, and I weighed myself ... I AM 150 KG, unfortunately this is the truth.
By consulting me with a dietician we planned a diet for a whole year, he also suggested that I keep a diary for each day of the diet ...
