Yesterday I looked in the mirror and I almost didn't recognize myself anymore, as soon as I saw my reflected image I exclaimed: <But who is this?>.
Until that moment I hadn't realized I realize how fat I was, until then I had deceived the truth with excuses such as: <But a jog is enough for me, eat less and I'll be thin as before>, 
 but the reality is often disappointing. 
With all the courage I had in my body, I took the scale, covered with months of dust, and I weighed myself ... I AM 150 KG, unfortunately this is the truth.
By consulting me with a dietician we planned a diet for a whole year, he also suggested that I keep a diary for each day of the diet ...

I had a coffee and did a few minutes of stretching and push-ups, I did the shower, I brushed my teeth and went on my bicycle to go to work, like every day. During my lunch break at work I ate potato dumplings and a salad accompanied by fresh fruit. Returned from work at 4 pm I went running for about 45 minutes. When I got home I took a shower and ate an apple, it was 5pm. Finally at dinner I ate bresaola with parmesan flakes and always fresh fruit. I went to sleep but not before writing a page of this diary and brushing my teeth.

Today is Valentine's Day and therefore as already decided I will finish writing my diary but obviously I will continue my diet, but maybe with some more sweets, but I will always be careful not to eat too much, as it takes a lot of time, commitment and effort. to lose weight rather than to take it.
